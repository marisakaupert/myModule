My Module is a UI that creates models, prints custom greetings to the Script Editor, and parses through a text file. The functions in myModule were based off assignments given by Geordie Martinez in his course on https://www.cgcircuit.com/ .

## To use: ##
* Download myModule.py
* Put myModule.py in your Maya scripts directory or add the folder with myModule.py to your python path
* Type this into the Script Editor:
```python
import myModule
reload(myModule)
myModule.run()
```
